### Dataset version: v1.0 

## Description

This repository includes "high-confidence" pKa data digitized from three reference works:
 - **Serjeant**: International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, E. P Serjeant and Boyd Dempsey. *Ionisation Constants of Organic Acids in Aqueous Solution*; Oxford/Pergamon, 1979 (Oxford IUPAC chemical data series)
 - **Perrin**: International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, DD Perrin. *Dissociation Constants of Organic Bases in Aqueous Solution*; Butterworths, 1965
 - **Perrin Supplement**: International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, DD Perrin. *Dissociation Constants of Organic Bases in Aqueous Solution, Supplement*;  Butterworths, 1972

With permission from the copyright holder, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the reference books were scanned, converted to digital data, checked for accuracy, and curated for accessibility, interoperability, and reusability between the dates of Friday, Sept. 10, 2021 and Thursday, Sept. 15, 2022 by Jonathan Zheng (jonzheng@mit.edu).

Further data was collected that is not included in this dataset. "Low-confidence" data (i.e. only one source translating IUPAC name to SMILES; or different name translators gave different results) were excluded, as well as entries whose names could not be programatically translated. Raw scans of the reference books are also excluded from this data set.

This is the first release of the dataset. Please email jonzheng@mit.edu if any errors are discovered.

## Methodological Information

This dataset was obtained by scanning the reference books listed above, and then using OCR (Amazon Textract) to extract the images into text. After some light processsing of the intermediate data files, scripts were then written to process the text into an organized tabular format that resembles the layout of the textbook, to aid members of the Green Group at MIT manually check the digital data for fidelity to the original reference data. The digital tables were then processed again to extract the information to a convenient form for computational use, and to attempt to translate the IUPAC names to SMILES strings. This final format was then manually and programatically checked. *More information can be found in the report attached in the repository.*

Proprietary software Amazon Textract was used to perform the OCR, and Chemaxon Molconvert was used to aid in translating IUPAC names to structures. 

Open-source software used to aid in the OCR process: `unpaper`, `OCRmyPDF`, `camelot`, `tabula`. IUPAC to SMILES translation was aided by `OPSIN`, PubChem, and the Chemical Identifier Resolver.

Sample Jupyter notebooks showing the data extraction process are included in this repository to demonstrate the processing methods. Packages `rdkit` and `pandas` are required to run the demos at minimal capacity. For extended usability, install `pubchempy` and `cirpy` as well.

**To run the Jupyter notebooks:** Install the required prerequisite packages. Run the Jupyter notebooks in order from 1 to 3. You should not need to alter any of the scripts. If running the minimal example without `pubchempy` and `cirpy`, either comment out or skip the cells that involve those packages.

`1_automatically_process_messy_OCR_demo` takes the OCR output from Amazon Textract and organizes into human-readable tables. 

`2_combine_and_analyze_scanned_work_serjeant` takes the human-readable tables and further processes them to computer-readable tables.

`3_further_process_data` further takes the computer-readable data and performs final processing on the data, resulting in the final polished dataset format presented here.

## Quality assurance
Before publication, several programmed checks were performed on the dataset.
 * Checking range and distribution of pKa values.
 * Checking for common typos in Remarks, pKa types, temperatures, and chemical names.
 * Manual review of all entries that failed to produce a SMILES (in case the translation failure was caused by a name typo).
 * Standardizing formats (e.g. formatting "pk" as "pK", "pKa" as "pK1", standardizing "V. Uncert." versus "Very Uncert.", etc.).

## Data-specific information

### **Columns**:
* `entry_#`: Order of the chemical species in the original reference work.
* `SMILES`: SMILES string translated from the IUPAC names provided in the original reference work.
* `pka_type`: Type of dissociation constant. Examples: pKAH1 = conjugate acid's first dissociation; pKb = basic dissociation constant; The vast majority of entries will be of the form pKAH, pKA, or pKB, but there are some exceptions in the reference works that include parentheses to identify an unusual protonation site or structure, e.g. pK(indole-ring) is pK for protonation on indole ring; pK(cis) to refer to protonation for the cis structure. (This convention may be changed in a later version).
* `pka_value`: the pK value
* `T`: temperature (deg. C)
* `remarks`: Comments for this specific datapoint.
* `method`: Code for the method used to determine this datapoint.
* `assessment`: IUPAC critical evaluation of the data uncertainty.
* `ref`: Code for the reference to the original source of this datapoint. Note: While we work on validating the digitized reference codes, scanned images of the reference codes are available in the `refs` folder. 
* `ref_remarks`: Remarks pertaining specifically to the reference for this entry; e.g. "Thermodynamic quantities are derived from the results".
* `entry_remarks`: Remarks pertaining to all entries for this chemical species, usually pointers to other data sources (e.g. Other values in B10).
* `original_IUPAC_names`: IUPAC identifier for the chemical species originally presented in the reference work (with a few exceptions, see the report for details).
* `name_contributors`: The names of the methods that produced viable SMILES names from the IUPAC translation.
* `num_name_contributors`: The number of methods that yielded a successful SMILES translation.
* `original_IUPAC_nicknames`: Secondary names identified from the IUPAC identifier for the chemical species originally presented in the reference works
* `source`: Name of the reference book: perrin, perrin_supp, or serjeant .
* `unique_ID`: Unique identifier combining the `source` and the `entry_#` to create a code that matches to the chemical species.
* `pressure`: Pressure (a handful of entries include very high pressure entries which might yield unexpected results if not filtered, so this column is added to help filter these out).
* `acidity_label`: Descriptor indicating whether the pK is an acidic (A), conjugate acid (AH), or basic (B) dissociation constant.

### **Rows**: 
There are 21,147 rows corresponding to 8,843 unique molecules in the dataset.

Specialized abbreviations used: 
* `pK`: dissociation constant of any type, e.g. a pKa, pKAH, pKB, etc.
* `pKa`: acid dissociation constant
* `pk1, pk2, pk3, ...`: first, second, third (etc) acid dissociation constants
* `pKAH`: acid dissociation constant of a base's conjugate acid
* `pKB`: base dissociation constant, or 14-pKAH
* `I`: ionic strength, equal to 1/2 * Sum(ci * zi^2)
* `m`: concentration in mole/1000g of water
* `c`: concentration in mole/L
* `Îº`: specific conductance of water used, in 10^-6 ohm^-1 cm^-1
* `T`: temperature (usually in deg. C)
* `H0`: Hammett acidity function; other acidity functions follow a similar nomenclature e.g. H_, HR, etc.

In the case of data uncertainty, the evaluation originally posited by the authors is to used "Reliable", "Approximate", and "Uncertain" evaluations. The suggested reliability for these designations is:
* Reliable: ÎpK <= +/- 0.005
* Approximate: ÎpK <= +/- 0.04
* Uncertain: ÎpK > 0.04
